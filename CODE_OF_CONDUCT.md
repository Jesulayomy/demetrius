# Contributor Code of Conduct

---

### Our Pledge

Here, we are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race and religion.

### Our Standards

To create a positive environment, we expect the following behaviors from all contributors:

* Use welcoming language.
* Show respect for differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
* Focus on what is best for the community.
* Demonstrate empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Usage of sexualized language or imagery, as well as unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks.
* Harassment, whether public or private.
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
* Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we are responsible for establishing and enforcing acceptable standards of behavior. We are committed to taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces associated with this project, both online and offline. This includes project spaces and public spaces where an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representation include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project maintainers may further define and clarify the representation of a project.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project [team](mailto:jesulayomy@gmail.com?subject=%5BIMPORTANT%5D%3A%20Complaint). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the reporter of any incident. Further details on specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
